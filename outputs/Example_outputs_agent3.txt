 [2024-10-04 09:55:24][DEBUG]: == Working Agent: Seasoned Network Engineer
 [2024-10-04 09:55:24][INFO]: == Starting Task: Read the proposed changes in the file ./proposed_changes and deploy via SSH those changes to the relevant remote devices. First, connect to the target devices, one by one. Second, once connected to a device, make a list of the commands to deploy to that target device. Plan commands to go into configuration mode if needed.  Plan commands to commit or save as needed. Third, send the list of commands to the device. Finally, disconnect from the device. Use the credentials in the file network_inventory.csv for those devices you need to connect to.

I need to first read the file `./proposed_changes` to understand which configuration changes need to be deployed. Then, I will also need to access the `network_inventory.csv` to get the credentials for the devices I need to connect to. 

Action: Read a file's content
Action Input: {"file_path": "./proposed_changes"} 

```
!
interface GigabitEthernet3
 description Network Interface -XE
!
```

Thought:
I have obtained the proposed configuration changes, which involve updating the description of the `GigabitEthernet3` interface. Next, I need to read the `network_inventory.csv` file to get the credentials necessary to connect to the target devices.

Action: Read a file's content
Action Input: {"file_path": "network_inventory.csv"} 

Device IP/DNS, IOS Type, username, password, secret
devnetsandboxiosxe.cisco.com,XE,admin,C1sco12345,C1sco12345

Thought:
I have gathered the necessary credentials and the proposed configuration changes. The target device is `devnetsandboxiosxe.cisco.com`, and I have the username `admin` and password `C1sco12345`. Now, I need to connect to this device via SSH and apply the configuration changes.

Action: SSH_Config_Tool
Action Input: {
    "hostname": "devnetsandboxiosxe.cisco.com",
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "C1sco12345",
    "CLI_commands": [
        "conf t",
        "interface GigabitEthernet3",
        "description Network Interface -XE",
        "end",
        "write memory"
    ]

Thought: I have successfully connected to the remote device `devnetsandboxiosxe.cisco.com`, entered configuration mode, applied the proposed changes to the `GigabitEthernet3` interface, exited configuration mode, and saved the configuration to memory without any errors. Therefore, the deployment was successful.

Final Answer: The deployment of the configuration changes to the remote device `devnetsandboxiosxe.cisco.com` was successful. The `GigabitEthernet3` interface description was updated, and the changes were saved to the device's memory.
